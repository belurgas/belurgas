### About me
I'm a young entrepreneur, engineer, and developer. I work on closed projects, so my GitHub activity isn't much, as I occasionally try to contribute, but it's difficult. I'm very dedicated to my craft and love learning everything. I've been doing this for about eight years (I've been coding in Basic since I was a kid). I'm a very social person and connect with anyone who interests me 🫰
